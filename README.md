my first attempt on using unity game engine

game is ~1k lines total (smaller than headers files for my renderer)
I am not sure why, but even simplest unity project i've seen are tens and hundreds of files for something i would not even call a game

codestyle is fucked
whole game is a single monobeh class (which is considered bad practice (by those who create 100kloc clickers that do not even work))
c# features are sometimes ignored or misused (c# problem, not mine)

i would do same in cpp in like 0.1 of time spent (~12 hours) and also in pure (lum-al) Vulkan and build would be ~5 mb. Experiment is over, and i will not use unity for any of my games
